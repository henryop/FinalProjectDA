#H3 Recommender-System-on-MovieLens-dataset #H3
# Project Overview #
Knowledge-based, Content-based and Collaborative Recommender systems are built on MovieLens dataset with 100,000 movie ratings. These Recommender systems were built using Pandas operations and by fitting KNN, SVD & deep learning models which use NLP techniques and NN architecture to suggest movies for the users based on similar users and for queries specific to genre, user, movie, rating, popularity.

# About the dataset used #
This data set consists of:

100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies.
Each user has rated at least 20 movies.
Simple demographic info for the users (age, gender, occupation, zip)
